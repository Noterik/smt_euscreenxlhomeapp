00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Good evening.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,300
A third year of TV exercises has just ended.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,900
Hopefully you enjoyed your exercise during the past 52 weeks

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,600
And during this time you also learned something about the importance of 
physical activity for health.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I would like you to get used to exercise not only in front of the TV.

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,200
When you have a bit of free time and hear good music...

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,300
...don't keep sitting in that chair!

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,900
Do some exercise or have a dance...

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:37,200
...simply try to make physical activity and rhythm part of your life.

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,000
Today, Arnoš Hanuš, the pianist who has been playing for us the whole year...

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,800
...and those who had been doing exercise will join us.

12
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,800
You have found out yourself how healthy such gymnastics could be.

13
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,800
You might have lost your belly and your body looks better.
 
14
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:52,500
I wish everyone gains the joys of physical activity from our exercises

15
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,500
and finds the strength to overcome their own laziness.

16
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,300
Dear friends, thank you for your attention. 

17
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,300
I also want to thank you for the lovely and encouraging letters.

18
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
In the coming years...

19
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,800
...I hope that you find physical and mental freshness and the ...

20
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,700
...eternal fountain of youth, health and a joy of life.

21
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,000
Goodbye.
