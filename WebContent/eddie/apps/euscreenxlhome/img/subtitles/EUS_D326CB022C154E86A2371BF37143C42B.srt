1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,300
Let's do some exercises!

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,500
Good evening, dear friends.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,500
Good evening to all who are watching us.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,900
We have just said good bye to the old year 

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,400
and everybody should have some new year's resolutions

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,700
and we do hope that one resolution is not missing there.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,200
An moment of daily exercise. 

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,900
But before we start let us introduce ourselves.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,200
Eva Blažíèkov - physical art education instructor. 

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,400
Pavel Belšan - methodist of the Czechoslovak Union 
of Physical Education

10
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,300
and Mrs. Elena Mikešov will accompany us on the piano.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,400
For the whole year we will be meeting 3 times a week 

12
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,200
to improve our physical and mental condition

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,300
and finding together what we miss so much in the current way of life.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,400
Physical activity! And the best will be to start right now.

15
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,700
Great! But we will need a stick, a long bar or ruler.

16
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,800
Or you know what? A vacuum cleaner tube!

17
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,500
This exercise you all surely know, but you may not know

18
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,600
that the ancient Greeks used such an exercise

19
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:27,200
to improve the fast reflexes and mobility of their warriors.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,900
So that was just the introduction. 

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,200
You can improve your reflexes this way every day

22
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,200
and if you were not very successful, you have one more reason to do exercise with us. 

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,900
We have an idea, what you'd like to tell us. 

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,500
That the exercise was too difficult, mainly to keep the coordination.

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,900
You are right, but we decided for this exercise intentionally

20
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,200
to be able to make you a promise that in couple of weeks 

21
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,400
you will be able to do this exercise by yourself

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,500
but only if you will regularly exercise with us.

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,400
And now something really simple for everyoneÉPut your arms down.

23
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,800
Each of you surely did this.

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,700
I am just going to ask if there is anybody who keeps still sitting.

25
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,500
Join us! You haven't missed anything.

26
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,600
Another exercise will be in a sitting position.

27
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,200
Straight sitting position. Put your hand out and heels up... 

28
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,800
...and kick with your tips of the toes to the floor! 

29
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,100
Pull your neck!

30
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,800
And another excerciseÉ

31
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,800
Keep in the sitting position.

32
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,100
Put the hands aside, obliquely forward, straight forwardÉ as far as you can. And back.

33
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,500
Or only with one hand.

34
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,600
So one more time

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,200
put the hands on the sides of your body, obliquely forward, as far forward...

36
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,900
...and quickly back and make yourself nicely straight.

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,800
And another exercise will strengthen the abdominal and back muscles,

38
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,200
which shouldn't be missing in any warm-up.

38
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,600
Press your spine firmly to the floor.

39
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,000
And press your spine...

40
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,200
...and in the curved position move back.

41
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,500
And if you have nobody at home to hold your legs, you could ring the neighbours

42
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,600
or put them under a cupboard.

43
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,600
Hi to all who those who were doing exercise with us!

44
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,300
And see you.
