1
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and a small-scale development institute

2
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.500
he is definitely an organic architect."

3
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
but the forms evolve through the working process”

4
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
there may have been ten variations created which were never mass produced."

5
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.500
The cult chair will soon be given a new lease of life, as production begins once again.

6
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.500
Niko Kralj was Head of the Department of Industrial Design at the Academy of Architecture until 1992.

7
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.500
In 1962, he received the National Award for design and architecture…

8
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and in 1965, The City of Ljubljana Prize for industrial design.

9
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
The New York Museum of Modern Art includes his chair in their collection.

10
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
"Kralj was a carpenter. He came from a family of carpenters

11
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
so he was very well acquainted with the material he worked with."

12
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.500
"What set Kralj apart from the others was his ability to bend plywood in two directions."

13
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Niko Kralj: "That was in Illinois with Professor Buckminster Fuller.

14
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
He was one of the famous American scientists who did not even graduate

15
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.500
but is now considered as an academic.

16
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.500
I was his guest there for two days."

17
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.500
"And what did you do there?"

18
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.500
"I was there as a fellowship holder of the Ford Foundation for Design."

19
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.500
"You were also in Israel?"

20
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
"In Israel for three years, and Sierra Leone. In different places."

21
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
"What kind of projects did you work on there?"

22
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
"What kind of projects? I ran the Institute of Design."

23
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.500
It is important to speak of this chair

24
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.500
in the socio-political context of the time when a new country was being developed

25
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.500
new industrial plants were being generated and a new type of consumer was born

26
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.500
one with a low purchasing power.

27
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.500
"His desire was to bring a high-quality product, such as the Rex chair, into every home.

28
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.000
"Unfortunately, at that time this form was not appreciated as he would have desired."

29
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.500
"It was mainly appreciated by intellectuals, rather than by ordinary people."

30
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.500
"But what counts and what was important was that the product was cheap

31
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.500
it had been mass produced and was a good quality design."

32
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.500
"There is no special art in designing…

33
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.500
one simply must listen to the natural course of development

34
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and consider things that correspond to the functionality, design and technology

35
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
in a positive fashion."

36
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.500
"In the end, there is no special artistry in designing."
