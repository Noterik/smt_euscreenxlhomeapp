The University freshman year of 1963 is ending soon.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.500
Here a television crew attends the last freshman event in the Ljubljana region.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.500
Agronomy students have arranged their party on the University campus.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.500
The invitation promised "kindness for heart and soul".

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.500
The students danced and celebrated the end of the year.

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.500
But the television crew reported that the party was not outrageous.

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Compared to last year it was very refined: no fights and no chairs broken.

8
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.500
Some were happy to listen to the music

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Others preferred to drink and talk

10
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
But everyone enjoyed twisting the night away

11
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Lado Leskovar sings

12
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
For some it has been a long night

13
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
There have been a few breakages but no trouble

14
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Overall, a fitting end to the freshman year
