1
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Despite the increase in funding for scholarships

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
the number of scholarships in Slovenia in 1963 fell considerably.

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Yet young people show a great desire for higher education

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Many are trying to find the financial resources to live while also studying.

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
For the fifth year running Maks Tankijevic has been supplying milk every day to the residential areas in Vic

6
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.500
all the way from Gradascica to the railway tracks.

7
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.500
He starts at four and by seven o'clock…

8
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.500
the boy with no scholarship has already delivered around 300 bottles of milk.

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.500
Three dinars per bottle is the retainer for the company’s best milkman.

10
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Maks also regularly sits his exams.

11
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
He is studying economic policy at the Faculty of Law.

12
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.500
He will surely become a good manager of an economic organisation

13
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
as he already knows too well what every cent means.

14
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
There are over 60 milk delivery boys in Ljubljana, and they are known for being hardworking and conscientious.

15
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.500
There are also other occupations that engage our young undergraduates.

16
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
The Institute of Statistics employs 15 young people…

17
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
…but during larger scale censuses this rises to over 150 male and female students.

18
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
It is hard to find occupations where young people don’t work.

19
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.500
Tone, who studies in the Electro-technical faculty, works at Ljubljana radio and television.

20
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
He controls USW transmitters and television links.

21
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.500
Although most students work…

22
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
…only a few are fortunate enough to find a job in the industry that may become their profession.

23
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.500
In Ljubljana’s Tehnograd there are fourteen part-time students employed

24
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.500
They work as contractors and architects and there is nothing but praise for them.

25
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.500
…but there is no greater satisfaction for the young designer than facing tomorrow's challenge…

26
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.500
…even when given the most difficult tasks by the professors.

27
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
At the excavation on Gregorčičeva Street which is unearthing a row of Roman houses…

28
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.500
…trainee historian Janez and trainee archaeologist Silvin have uncovered many interesting things.

29
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.500
They are gradually revealing the secrets of their future professions.

30
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.500
Of course there are hours of free time sacrificed for learning…

31
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.500
…but without the occasional job and experience students cannot attain their goals.

32
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
The aim of higher education is still not a possibility for all

33
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.500
Particularly for those who are not among the lucky four thousand students…

34
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.500
…who receive a scholarship and are awarded half a billion dinars by our society every month.
