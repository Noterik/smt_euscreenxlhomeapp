00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,500  
Niko Kralj: "My first job was in Stol Kamnik where we tackled a range of problems.”

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,500  
“I founded the first Yugoslav Slovenian bureau for design 

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and a small-scale development institute

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,000  
where we experimented with different materials, pressure and heat.”

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000  
"At that time we also began design work in the Stol factory."

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000  
"Despite the fact that Niko Kralj worked in a time of functionalism

7
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,500
he is definitely an organic architect."

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,500  
“His products are not being produced as final forms

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
but the forms evolve through the working process”

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,500  
“For example, the chair Rex."  

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000  
“Between Rex 120 and the folding armchair Rex 5654 which has become so famous  

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
there may have been ten variations created which were never mass produced."

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,500
The cult chair will soon be given a new lease of life, as production begins once again.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,500
Niko Kralj was Head of the Department of Industrial Design at the Academy of Architecture until 1992.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,500
In 1962, he received the National Award for design and architecture… 

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and in 1965, The City of Ljubljana Prize for industrial design. 

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The New York Museum of Modern Art includes his chair in their collection. 

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
"Kralj was a carpenter. He came from a family of carpenters

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
so he was very well acquainted with the material he worked with." 

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,500
"What set Kralj apart from the others was his ability to bend plywood in two directions."

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Niko Kralj: "That was in Illinois with Professor Buckminster Fuller. 

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
He was one of the famous American scientists who did not even graduate

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,500
but is now considered as an academic. 

24
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,500
I was his guest there for two days."

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,500
"And what did you do there?"

26
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,500
"I was there as a fellowship holder of the Ford Foundation for Design."

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,500
"You were also in Israel?"

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
"In Israel for three years, and Sierra Leone. In different places."

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
"What kind of projects did you work on there?"

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
"What kind of projects? I ran the Institute of Design."

31
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,500
It is important to speak of this chair

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,500
in the socio-political context of the time when a new country was being developed

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,500
new industrial plants were being generated and a new type of consumer was born 

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,500
one with a low purchasing power.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,500
"His desire was to bring a high-quality product, such as the Rex chair, into every home. 

36
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,000
"Unfortunately, at that time this form was not appreciated as he would have desired." 

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,500
"It was mainly appreciated by intellectuals, rather than by ordinary people." 

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,500
"But what counts and what was important was that the product was cheap

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,500
it had been mass produced and was a good quality design."

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,500
"There is no special art in designing…

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,500
one simply must listen to the natural course of development

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
and consider things that correspond to the functionality, design and technology

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
in a positive fashion."

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,500
"In the end, there is no special artistry in designing."
